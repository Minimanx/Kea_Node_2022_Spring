http.createServer() similar to Express, just the basic form. You could make your own express package from this for example.

If a client could ask for any file on the backend and get it, it would be very insecure.
That's why we choose to serve a specific (public) folder as static.

Client server model: We send a request, we get a response.

Servers cant send anything unprompted to client, therefore they invented websockets. A protocol.

Two keywords. Emit - Emits data. On - On receiving data, takes a callback function that does something.

Because we're serving our HTML from our server, we don't have to deal with origins and ports when making a socket in our HTML
Same as CORS, etc.

CDN content delivery network.

{ data } = destructure

Rooms and namespaces are ways to seperate things in websockets (.io)

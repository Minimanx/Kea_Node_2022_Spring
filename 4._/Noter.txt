npm + maven = build tools
hard seperation between programming languages and build tools

package.json npm
pom.xml maven

npm + maven (build tools) do 3 things:
defines dependencies (packages)
build steps (scripts in npm)
meta data (npm init fx)



scripts in npm is bash (anything you write in terminal)

PORT=9090 nodemon.cmd app.js
npm i cross-env

cross-env in script invokes a script


app.get("/"... etc) = route
router = object with many routes
